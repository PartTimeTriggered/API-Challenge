# Unit 6 Homework: What's the Weather Like?

In this homework we were tasked with building two sets of code with API calls. 


The first set of code is "WeatherPy" - To run this code please add your Open Weather API into the "config.py" file then run code in a jupyter enviroment. This will generate a series of graphs to the output folder and build the base for out next code.


The second set of code is "VacationPy" - To run this code please add your Google Places API into the "config.py" file then run code in a jupyter enviroment. This will generate hotel choices based off your "ideal weather" and measured against the 500 random samples from "WeatherPy".


Please note there is also two screenshots of the outputs of "VacationPy" in the "images" folder.
